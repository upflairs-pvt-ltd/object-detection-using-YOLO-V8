# Yolo V8 Complete Guidance

in which repository, you will get understanding about yolo V8 pre-trained model guidance,
where you will understand that, how we can utilize the functionality of pre-trained yolo V8
model,<br>
and also you will learn how we can fine-tuned a yolo V8 pre-trained on your custome dataset,<br>

so in which repository, you will be able to find two jupyter notebook,
1. yolo_v8_pretrained.ipynb
2. yolo_v8_finetuned.ipynb

### yolo_v8_pretrained.ipynb
in this repository, you will be see entire guidance with readable comments to understant that, how we can utilize the yolo V8 pre-train model,<br>
how we can perform object detection on an image, using yolo V8 and yolo V5 model.
how we can perform object detection on an video, using yolo V8 and yolo V5 model.
how we can perform object detection using webcame, using yolo V8 yolo V5 model.

### yolo_v8_finetuned.ipynb
in this repository, you will be see entire guidance to fine-tuned the yolo V8 model on our custome dataset,<br>
in this repository you will be only see fine-tuning process of Yolo V8, But
if you want to also understand the Yolo V5 fine-tuning, <br>
click on <a href="https://github.com/Ranjit-Singh-786/object_detection_using_yolov5">Yolo V5 fine-tuning process</a><br>

complete project using yolo v8, on custome dataset, checkout this repoistory, click on given below link :
<a href="https://github.com/Ranjit-Singh-786/fracture_detection_yoloV8">Project using Yolo V8</a>

### Data Annotation
How we can perform Data Annotation for the yolo versions, you will get also understanding about too, in this repository<br>
#### Data Annotation tool
1. LabelImg
2. Roboflow

### All are outputs and Logs
All are outputs and Logs are saved in "runs/" directories,
